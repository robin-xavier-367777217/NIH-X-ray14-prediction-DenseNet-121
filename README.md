# NIH Chest X-ray14 Disease Prediction

A deep learning project to predict 14 common thoracic pathologies from chest X-ray images using a DenseNet-121 model with transfer learning. This project was developed as part of my data science internship.

## üéØ Project Goal

The main objective of this project was to build and train a multi-label classification model capable of identifying the presence of 14 different diseases from a single chest X-ray, based on the [NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-center-provides-one-largest-publicly-available-chest-x-ray-datasets-scientific-community).

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* Python
* PyTorch
* torchvision
* Pandas
* scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Kaggle (for GPU training)

## üìä Results

The model was trained in several stages, progressively unfreezing layers of the DenseNet architecture to fine-tune it on the X-ray data. The final performance on the test set, measured by the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for each pathology, is shown below:

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

To use the trained model for prediction on a new X-ray image:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies (You can add a `requirements.txt` file later):**
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision Pillow
    ```

3.  **Run the prediction script:**
    ```bash
    python -m features.xray_predictor.predict /path/to/your/xray_image.jpeg
    ```
