# NIH Chest X-ray14 Disease Prediction

A deep learning project to predict 14 common thoracic pathologies from chest X-ray images using a DenseNet-121 model with transfer learning. This project was developed as part of my data science Up-Skilling.

---

## üéØ Project Goal

The main objective was to build and train a multi-label classification model capable of identifying the presence of 14 different diseases from a single chest X-ray, based on the [NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-center-provides-one-largest-publicly-available-chest-x-ray-datasets-scientific-community).

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch & torchvision
- Pandas & scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Kaggle (for GPU training)

---

## üìä Results

The model was trained in several stages, progressively unfreezing layers of the DenseNet architecture to fine-tune it on the X-ray data. The final performance on the test set, measured by the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for each pathology, is shown below.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

Follow these steps to set up the project and run predictions.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/robin-xavier-367777217/NIH-X-ray14-prediction-DenseNet-121.git](https://github.com/robin-xavier-367777217/NIH-X-ray14-prediction-DenseNet-121.git)
cd NIH-X-ray14-prediction-DenseNet-121
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
It's highly recommended to use the provided `requirements.txt` file to ensure a consistent environment.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Prediction Script
Provide the path to an X-ray image to get a prediction.
```bash
python -m features.xray_predictor.predict /path/to/your/xray_image.jpeg
```
